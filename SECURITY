The validate-sender program (as well as the mybadmailfrom program)
only checks the SENDER environment variable.  This variable is set
by qmail-command using the value of MAIL FROM: from the SMTP
conversation.  This can easily be forged, so you should not trust
anything mission critical to the validate-sender program.  It is
only meant to help with trivial checks.
