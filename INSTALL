To install quser just unpack the tarball, cd into the quser src
directory, and do the normal make and  make install routine.

  tar xzf quser-0.8.tar.gz
  cd quser-0.8
  make
  make test (optional)
  sudo make install

cmaildir will be installed in /usr/local/bin/ while validate-sender,
validate-recipient, mybadmailto, and mybadmailfrom will be installed
in /var/qmail/bin/ . If you don't like this then just change the
Makefile, but I feel that these are the best places for these programs.
